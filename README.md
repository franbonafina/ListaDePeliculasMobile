This project its a solution to an exercise .
Mainly done with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction)

## Statement

Create a simple album list, photo list and photo detail application, using data from:

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com. Make sure that you use Redux and persist the data, so that if you close and open the app it doesn’t fetch again.

Your project should be hosted on GitHub and shared with users steppannws, gianko and mouzofabricio​. Don’t forget to add your name to your GitHub profile. 

There are no rules other than it should run (after running npm install) on iOS and Android, just make it cool and try to keep your commits clear!

You will be judged on things like architecture, readability, animation, git usage, design, performance, third party usage and more.

### Cloning the App

```
$ git clone https://github.com/franbonafina/reactNativeExample
$ cd reactNativeExample
```

Once this is done, there are some commands you can run in the project directory:

#### `npm install`
Install the dependencies .

#### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start --reset-cache
# or
yarn start --reset-cache
```

#### `npm test`

Runs the [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) test runner on your tests.
